For my project my goal was to use the Spotify API to be able to make a custom playlist for a user based on the artist they entered in a search box. 

Because I've never attempted anything like this I had to plenty of research to understand how the Spotify API works and integrate it. I also wanted the webpage to have a nice look/feel that somewhat matches Spotify's style and had to work on my HTML/CSS skills as well.

I decided to import a font family from Google Fonts, which was pretty easy to implement. (Google Fonts Api was much easier to understand than Spotify) 

Ultimately my goals for this application/project is to be able to do the following:
    - Have the User sign-in, authorize, and connect to their Spotify account
    - Select an Artist(s) from a dropdown menu
    - Select the max or min amount of songs they want in the playlist 
    - Make sure there are no duplicates 
    - Name the newly made playlist
    - Generate it. 

These are rather ambitious goals for me since I've never worked with an API before. Despite my rookie status with API's I wanted to atleast wanted the user to be able to connect and authorize their account and populate a dropdown menu with an artist list.

This will probably become an ongoing personal project as it's something I'd like to use in the future and I'm sure other music buffs would too. I'd also be interested in making an Apple Music variant with help.   

This project will use the following languages: HTML/CSS, Java, JavaScript as they're the ones I'm most familiar with. 

To launch the site I used Netlify as it was suggested in the Assignment description and the setup seemed to be the simplest, as I could connect it straight from my Github repository. 

Update: After attempting to complete the project using Java, I've decided to instead work with Node.js (https://nodejs.org) as it may be easier, there were some examples online and I can use it with another UI I found online called Semantic-Ui (https://semantic-ui.com/introduction/getting-started.html) which gives more menu customization (show artist name and Spotify profile image for better identifcation).
